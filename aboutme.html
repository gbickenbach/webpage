          Hello there!

    <p1> I am Gabriel. I am from Colombia. This means you’ll often find me listening to vallenatos and eating exotic tropical fruits. The more exotic, the better. 
        I am weird and authentic. Every single night I go to sleep with a pair of cozy Christmas socks my mother gave me when I was eight. They are quite pathetic.
        Everyday, as I ride the bus to school through Bogotá’s nightmarish traffic jams, I brainstorm ways in which the city’s mobility could be improved to benefit its eight million citizens. In my spare time, I enjoy watching tennis, soccer, and Formula One. I follow and admire Novak Djokovic and Lewis Hamilton for their authenticity and grit. 
        I talk a lot in my sleep, usually about my family, my friends, and my beloved marching band. I love my record player, which I often use while working. For some reason, my ideas surge exponentially in quality when The Beatles’ Rubber Soul is on. I like watching narratively complex movies like Interstellar and The Truman Show, and reading books about philosophy like When Nietzsche Wept. My favorite class has always been math. Wildlife conservation keeps me up at night, and studying Colombia’s culture and history drives my identity. 
        At parties in Colombia, salsa is inescapable. But I’ve always been a bit awkward, preferring to stand on the sidelines. Recently I’ve focused on a process of escaping my comfort zone and embracing the uncomfortable. I can’t wait to continue that process at Dartmouth.
